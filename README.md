PayPal Express Checkout API
The Application that I have built is very simple with the Express Checkout integrated in it. The appilcation was built in Java with JSP pages.The PayPal Integration wizard was used. 
The first page lists the products and pre-selected item. When the 'Check out with PayPal' button is pressed, the PayPal's login page of the buyer appears where the credentials are to be entered. Once the order is confirmed with the shipping details, the transaction details are returned to the application page where it is displayed to the user.
